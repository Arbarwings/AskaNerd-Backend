## Introduction

Nerds can register and enter keywords on which they want to be found. The 'normal' person ask a question / requested service with a compensation / reward. The system searches the nearest nerd that matches the keywords by comparing the entered information. The nerd receives a push notification in which he can accept or reject the offer of the 'normal' person. As soon as the nerd has accepted the offer, the 'normal' person will also receive a push notification that they have a match. Now those people can chat and help each other out.

Example situation:<br />
Sanne (the 'normal' person) asks the following question: Help I have a virus on my laptop. Who can remove it? As a reward I take you to the cinema.
Rick (the nerd) fits in the requested profile and accepts the offer.<br /><br />
Win win situation:<br />
Sanne has a laptop without a virus and Rick has a nice night out.
